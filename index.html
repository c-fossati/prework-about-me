      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        Hi, my name is Cathy. I'm your instructor for the Full Stack Bootcamp.
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>
        Birmingham Michigan is my home. I grew up in Grosse Pointe and have
        lived in Birmingham all my adult life.
      </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>
        Web Development. Hopefully it is or will become your hobby as well. It
        is a constant learning curve as there is always something new to learn.
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>
        One that allows me to travel, pays me enough to enjoy my life and enough
        time to enjoy it.
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>In lovely Birmingham Michigan</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>
        Of all the hats I've worn, software development was my favorite. I'm
        always learning, so I'm not bored. It's in demand so it has job security
        and good pay. It's ideally suited for working remotely. Generally you're
        not required to go to too many meetings.
